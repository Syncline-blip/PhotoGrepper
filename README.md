PHOTO GREPPER


Currently WIP

PhotoGrepper is a photo downloader using Reddit (via https://www.popular.pics/) to save photos from particular subreddit. The Application uses C#/.NET and Selenium

What's working:
  - Able to download photos from subreddits and users in https://www.popular.pics/ for example : https://www.popular.pics/reddit/subreddits/posts?r=EarthPorn
  - Application is able to make a new directory for the photos downloaded. If the directory already exists, the application does not overwrite the contents.
  - Has an adblocker features to avoid saving images from ads in the used reddit gallery view

Currently working on:
  - Fixing a bug where images to be downloaded are not being counted properly.
  - Creating a UI so that the application can be run via a simple new UI window rather than command line
  - Working on allowing different filters such as:
      ->  Using reddit filters to download from Hot/Top/New/Rising/Controversial + Time Filters i.e: Hour/Day/Week/Month/Year/All Time
      ->  Filter to allow users to limit the number of photos they want downloaded. At the moment, when the program is run, it will just keep running
          and downloading all pcitures within the page.
